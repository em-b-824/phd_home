## This is a summary and motivation of my PhD 

Modelling and critically engaging with positive tipping points  
* Use modelling methods to explore research gaps of the positive tipping points literature  
    * networks - social structure 
    * contagion - normative influence
    * abms - psychologically plausible decision models
* Use a case study to explore these research gaps and modelling methods - dietary change as a tipping point within food systems  

### Dietary change
#### Motivation
Agriculture sucks atm
We eat too much meat
Its a cool change not necessesarily driven by technology, but by social change
#### Mechanisms
Dietary choices are driven by 
* personal behavioural choices
* social norms 
* availability and accessability
* variety of food options,
